# Aircraft Anomaly Detection

This is a web application for aircraft anomaly detection using Flask and various anomaly detection models such as Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM, and K-Means. The application allows users to visualize anomalies in a dataset, as well as check if a specific set of aircraft attributes is anomalous.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Python (3.6 or higher)
- Flask
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- Pycharm
Install the required Python packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install Flask pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
```

### Installing

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/aircraft-anomaly-detection.git
```

2. Change into the project directory:

```bash
cd aircraft-anomaly-detection
```

3. Run the Flask application:

```bash
python main.py
```

The application will be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` in your web browser.

## Usage

- Visit the homepage (`/`) to plot graphs and visualize anomalies in the dataset.
- Click on "Check Your Plane" to input specific aircraft attributes and check if the plane is anomalous.

## Files and Directories

- `main.py`: The main Flask application.
- `your_anomaly_detection_module.py`: Anomaly detection module containing the `AnomalyDetectionModel` class.
